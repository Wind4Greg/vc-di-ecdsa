## ECDSA Data Integrity Cryptosuites

This specification describes a
[Data Integrity Cryptosuite](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-integrity/)
for use when generating a digital signature using the Elliptic Curve Digital
Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) based on the Standards for Efficient Cryptography
over prime fields using a verifiably random Elliptic Curve (secpr1).

We encourage contributions meeting the
[Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md). While we prefer the creation of
issues and Pull Requests in the GitHub repository, discussions also occur on the
[public-vc-wg](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-vc-wg/) mailing list.

## Process Overview for VC Data Model Pull Requests
1. Anyone can open a PR on the repository. Note that for the PR to be merged,
   the individual must agree to the
   [W3C Patent Policy](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/).
2. Once a PR is opened, it will be reviewed by the Editors and other WG
   Members.
3. The W3C CCG is automatically notified of PRs as they are raised and
   discussed.
4. PRs are usually merged in 7 days if there is adequate review and consensus,
   as determined by the Chairs and Editors.
